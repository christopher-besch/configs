# Chris' Configs
The `install.sh` script symlinks the dotfiles in this directory to wherever they belong.
There's a server and a desktop version.
The server version is basically a subset of all desktop configs that also work on an SSH server.

# How to Cook Like I Do?
1. Fork this repo,
2. adjust the configs to your liking
3. and run `./install.sh server` or `./install.sh desktop`.
   (Warning: this script permanently overwrites your current configs.)

# Gentoo Config
The [`gentoo` subdirectory](gentoo) contains my Gentoo configs.
The same three-step plan applies to it, with an addition to the third:
You have to run the `install.sh` script with root privileges (with `sudo`).
